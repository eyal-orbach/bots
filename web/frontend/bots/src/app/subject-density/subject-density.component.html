    Here you can search for users which mostly tweet about a single topic, meaning their topical variance is low. 
    <br>
    <span class="technical">Technical: Once tweets are represented as vectors, each user has a centroid (both euclidean and cosine centroids are calculated). 
    <br>Density is the user's variance with respect to the centroid, the returned users are ranked by both the centroid's distance from the given sentence and their density.</span>
