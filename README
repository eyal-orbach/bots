This application provides a set of tools that helps screening, filtering and viewing real data from Twitter.
It was developed by Eyal Orbach at the Bar Ilan University, NLP Lab as part of the Big Bots Project,
a project set to expose un-organic activity on the web, attempting to influence the Israeli 2019 elections.
The Big Bots Project has gained significant global and local news coverage.

This application does not claim to make the final classification between bots, puppets, fake or real users,
rather, it helps viewing Twitter data according to the described logic which can assist the end user to further investigate certain
users or interactions and classify them according to his or her logic.
It is easy to follow the links here to the actual Twitter accounts/comments and highly advised, to make your own mind according to your findings.

The project currently supports Hebrew data only, but it is my intention to have it support other languages and add more tools
in the future.
All the code for this project can be found on github.

The application works with pre-trained word-embeddings and precalculated tf/idf values.
Tweet similarity - Calculate similarity by a tf/idf weighted sum of w2v embeddings, and cosine/euclidean distance
Subject Density - Meta parameter sets a weight value between density of tweets and similarity to origin sentence
Density is calculated as the varience of the above described tweet vectors subject to their centroid.
Similarity to origin is the euclidean distance from centroid to given sentence.
Behaviour Similarity - The tweet vector here is modified by a pre-configured number of dimensions with its timestamp
value,
normalized by the minimal timestamp in the data. Users are ranked bby the sum of min distances between origin user's
tweets and their various tweets.
